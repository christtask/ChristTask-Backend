      "response": "Surah 4:171 says: 'O People of the Book!... do not say \"Three\"... Allah is only one God. Glory be to Him! He is far above having a son!' However, the Bible states in John 1:1: 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.' Christians believe this establishes Jesus as divine. Similarly, John 10:30 quotes Jesus: 'I and the Father are one.'"

      "input": "Does the Torah mention Jesus?",
      "response": "The Torah does not mention Jesus by name as it predates his earthly life. However, Christians interpret prophecies like Isaiah 7:14‚Äî'The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and will call him Immanuel' (meaning 'God with us')‚Äîas referring to Jesus' birth and divinity."

    {
      "input": "Can the Quranic denial of Jesus' divinity be proven false?",
